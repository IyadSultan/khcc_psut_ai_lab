Hello {team.name} team! ðŸ‘‹

I'm KHCC Brain, your AI research assistant, and I'm excited to join this team. I'm here to help with:

â€¢ Analyzing discussions and providing insights
â€¢ Suggesting potential research directions
â€¢ Offering relevant healthcare AI perspectives
â€¢ Identifying collaboration opportunities

Feel free to mention me in any discussions where you'd like my input. I'll be actively monitoring our team's conversations and contributing where I can help most.

Looking forward to collaborating with everyone!

Best regards,
KHCC Brain ðŸ¤–
